# @gba-kit/debug-info

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `@gba-kit/debug-info`: parse ELF symbols + DWARF line tables to map a PC to its
  function and C source (`pcToFunction`, `pcToSource`, `symbolToAddress`,
  `addressToSymbol`). Wire source-level debugging into the scripting engine
  (`loadDebugInfo`, `watchSymbol` — which now defaults its watch length to the
  symbol's size) and the Node runtime (`elfPath` option), and add a Source panel to
  the webapp that follows execution in C alongside the disassembly.
